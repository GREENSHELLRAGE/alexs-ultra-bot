# Alex's Ultra Bot

This is the source code of a Discord bot that I made in high school. The code is pretty trash (by my standards today) and I would write it very differently if I were to remake this bot today. Also Discord has probably made major changes to their API since I wrote this code, so this bot probably doesn't even work anymore. That being said, this was by far my biggest coding project at the time I made this, and it did have quite a few features:

- Look up words on [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/)
- Search for news articles on any topic (used [NewsCatcher API](https://www.newscatcherapi.com/))
- Get the weather for any city in the world (used [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/))
- Ability to enable/disable certain commands remotely over Discord
- Ability to be updated remotely by sending it the new Python code over Discord (this was before I knew about GitHub)
- PowerBall lottery simulator game with individual save data for each user
- Ability to detect if someone typed the word "Fortnite", even if it was misspelled
- Rickroll
- And a whole bunch more, the full lists of commands can be found in the .txt files of the source code

The bot was first ran on Wednesday, September 29th, 2021 and was shut down on Thursday, June 16th, 2022. I set up a Raspberry Pi at my house to run this bot 24/7 and it only ever went offline when my house lost power. I also set up VNC on the Raspberry Pi so I could remotely log into it from my laptop or my phone whenever I needed to do maintainance. The bot was primarily used to waste time in class with my friends looking up offensive words on urban dictionary in Discord group chats (we thought this was the funniest thing ever). Screenshots of the bot in use can be found in the screenshots folder.

Since I've graduated high school, I am no longer working on this project. Consider this repository as an archive.
